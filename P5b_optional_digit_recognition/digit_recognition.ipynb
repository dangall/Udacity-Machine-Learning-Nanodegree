    "## Step 1: Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits. Train the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) or [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). To produce a synthetic sequence of digits for testing, you can for example limit yourself to sequences up to five digits, and use five classifiers on top of your deep network. You would have to incorporate an additional ‘blank’ character to account for shorter number sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:\n",
    "- Your model can be derived from a deep neural net or a convolutional network.\n",
    "- You could experiment sharing or not the weights between the softmax classifiers.\n",
    "- You can also use a recurrent network in your deep neural net to replace the classification layers and directly emit the sequence of digits one-at-a-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use ** Keras ** to implement your model. Read more at [keras.io](https://keras.io/).\n",

    "Here is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42241.pdf). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPI_JvLoN0)). You are not expected to model your architecture precisely using this model nor get the same performance levels, but this is more to show an exampe of an approach used to solve this particular problem. We encourage you to try out different architectures for yourself and see what works best for you. Here is a useful [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/goodfellow-et-al-2013-architecture/202363) discussing the architecture as described in the paper and here is [another one](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/what-loss-function-to-use-for-multi-digit-svhn-training/176897) discussing the loss function."
